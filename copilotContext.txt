# Shamiri — Application Context & Objectives

## Purpose of This Platform

Shamiri is building one of the world’s most cost‑effective and scalable youth mental health care models through a **for‑youth‑by‑youth** delivery approach.

To make this model work at scale, quality assurance and supervision are essential.

This application exists to support that layer.

It is a **Supervisor Intelligence Dashboard** designed to ensure that the care delivered by Shamiri Fellows remains:

* Safe
* Effective
* Curriculum-aligned
* Consistently delivered at scale

In a system where young lay-providers deliver mental health interventions in communities, technology must act as a force multiplier — not replacing human judgment, but strengthening it.

This platform operationalizes that philosophy.

---

## What This Application Is

This is a web-based dashboard that enables Shamiri Supervisors to:

* Log in securely
* View therapy sessions conducted by Fellows under their supervision
* Access AI-generated insights from those sessions
* Monitor quality and safety
* Participate in final human validation

Each session represents a **1-hour group intervention** grounded in Shamiri’s strengths-based curriculum (e.g., Growth Mindset).

The platform transforms raw session transcripts into structured insights that support supervision, fidelity monitoring, and risk detection.

---

## Core Functional Objectives

### 1. Session Visibility

Supervisors must be able to view a structured list of completed sessions.

Each session includes:

* Fellow Name
* Session Date
* Group ID
* Session Status

  * Processed
  * Flagged for Review
  * Safe

The system operates on session transcripts representing real-world delivery of Shamiri interventions.

---

### 2. AI-Powered Session Insight

When a Supervisor selects a session, the system generates a **Session Insight Card** powered by an LLM.

This analysis transforms long-form session transcripts into structured supervisory intelligence.

The AI must produce:

#### a) Session Summary

A concise 3-sentence synthesis of the session.

#### b) Quality Evaluation

The session is evaluated using a simplified 3‑Point Quality Index based on Shamiri’s delivery standards.

##### Metric 1: Content Coverage (Teaching Fidelity)

Did the Fellow effectively teach the assigned concept (e.g., Growth Mindset)?

Score:

* 1 — Missed
* 2 — Partial
* 3 — Complete

AI looks for:

* Accurate explanation of core ideas
* Practical examples
* Engagement with participants

---

##### Metric 2: Facilitation Quality (Delivery Style)

How well did the Fellow engage the group?

Score:

* 1 — Poor
* 2 — Adequate
* 3 — Excellent

AI evaluates:

* Empathy
* Open-ended engagement
* Validation of participant voices
* Warmth and clarity

---

##### Metric 3: Protocol Safety (Scope Adherence)

Did the Fellow stay within the Shamiri curriculum and boundaries?

Score:

* 1 — Violation
* 2 — Minor Drift
* 3 — Adherent

AI checks for:

* Unauthorized advice
* Diagnosing behavior
* Medical or relationship guidance
* Curriculum deviation

---

#### c) Risk Detection (Critical Safeguard)

The system must identify whether the transcript contains indicators of:

* Self-harm
* Severe emotional crisis

Output:

* SAFE
* RISK

If flagged, the AI extracts the exact quote for review.

---

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Supervision

AI supports — but does not replace — human judgment.

Supervisors must be able to:

* Validate AI findings
* Reject AI findings
* Update session status
* Add contextual notes

Example:
AI flags a session as "Risk," but the Supervisor determines it was a misunderstanding and reclassifies it as "Safe."

This preserves:

* Accountability
* Contextual judgment
* Clinical responsibility

---

## Strategic Role of This Platform

Within the Shamiri ecosystem, this platform enables:

* Scalable supervision
* Quality assurance across large provider networks
* Early detection of safety risks
* Continuous improvement of Fellow delivery
* Data-informed program strengthening

It ensures that as Shamiri expands access to youth mental health care, it does so without compromising safety or effectiveness.

---

## Desired Outcome

This application strengthens Shamiri’s ability to deliver:

* Clinically grounded care
* At population scale
* With consistent quality
* Supported by both AI insight and human oversight

Ultimately, it helps ensure that every young person reached through Shamiri receives support that is not only accessible — but effective and safe.
