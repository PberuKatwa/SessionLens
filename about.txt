# Shamiri — Company Context Document

## About Shamiri

Shamiri is building one of the world’s most cost‑effective and scalable youth mental health care models.

Globally, 1 in 3 young people struggles with mental health challenges. In East Africa, fewer than 1 in 10 receive treatment. Traditional mental health systems are costly, depend on scarce professionals, and cannot scale to meet the growing need.

Shamiri exists to change this.

Our mission is simple: **make mental health work for all young people.**

We are proving that effective care does not require expensive, specialist‑heavy systems. Instead, it requires:

* Community-driven delivery
* Evidence-based interventions
* Smart use of technology
* A scalable workforce model

Built in Africa, for the world, Shamiri is redefining how mental health care can be delivered at population scale.

## The Problem

Youth mental health is one of the defining challenges of our time.

* 1 in 4 young people globally experiences depression or anxiety
* Over half of these conditions begin in adolescence
* 60% persist into adulthood if untreated

Despite this:

* 70% of youth globally cannot access care
* In East Africa, that number rises to 90%

Economic pressure, displacement, social change, and digital stressors are increasing the burden—especially in Africa, the world’s youngest continent.

Without scalable solutions, untreated mental health challenges threaten health, education outcomes, livelihoods, and long-term economic growth.

## Our Solution: The Shamiri Model

Shamiri delivers clinically effective mental health care using a **for‑youth‑by‑youth** approach.

Instead of relying solely on highly trained professionals, we use a three‑tier task‑shifting model endorsed by global health best practices.

### Tier 1: Shamiri Fellows

Young lay-providers (ages 18–24) deliver group-based sessions after just 10 hours of training.
They teach practical, strengths-based skills such as:

* Growth mindset
* Gratitude
* Problem-solving
* Values-based action

### Tier 2: Shamiri Supervisors

Semi-professionals provide:

* Training
* Oversight
* One-on-one support

### Tier 3: Shamiri Experts

Licensed psychologists and psychiatrists manage complex cases requiring intensive care.

This needs-based model ensures:

* Access at scale
* Quality control
* Clear escalation pathways

## Evidence-Based & Clinically Proven

Shamiri’s approach is grounded in rigorous research.

* Multiple gold-standard trials validate effectiveness
* 80% of youth show meaningful improvement after four sessions
* Benefits last up to two years

Participants also report:

* Better academic performance
* Stronger relationships
* Increased agency
* Improved long-term outcomes

Importantly, these outcomes are achieved at approximately **$7 per youth served** — making the model 10–100x more cost-effective than traditional therapy.
