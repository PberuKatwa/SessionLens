{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Hi everyone! Welcome back to our session. I hope you all had a good week. Before we get started, I just want to check in—how’s everyone feeling today?"},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I’m okay, I guess. Bit tired from school."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Same here. Lots of homework."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "I’m alright. Feeling a little stressed though."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I’m good, just busy with football practice."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "Feeling a bit anxious, honestly."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I’m fine, nothing much to report."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Thanks for sharing, everyone. That’s completely normal. Some of you are feeling stressed or tired, and that’s okay. Today we’re going to talk about something called a growth mindset. Has anyone heard that term before?"},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I think so? Is it like believing you can get better at something if you try?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yes, exactly, Jabari. A growth mindset is the idea that your abilities and intelligence can develop with effort, learning, and practice. It’s different from a fixed mindset, which assumes you’re either smart or not, and there’s nothing you can do to change that."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "So it’s basically like saying your brain is like a muscle you can train?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yes, Amani, that’s a great way to put it. Your brain can grow stronger when you challenge it and learn from mistakes."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "But what if you fail at something a lot? Doesn’t that mean you’re just bad at it?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Not necessarily, Keziah. A growth mindset sees failure as part of learning. Each time you make a mistake, it’s an opportunity to figure out what didn’t work and try a new strategy."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "That sounds nice in theory, but it’s hard to think that way when you’re failing in front of everyone."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I hear you, Leo. It can feel embarrassing or discouraging. The key is to focus on what you can control—your effort, your persistence, and how you respond to setbacks. That’s what actually makes your brain grow."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "So basically, if I’m struggling in math, it doesn’t mean I’m stupid?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Exactly, Sara. Struggling just shows that your brain is working on new connections. With practice, your understanding can improve."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I’ve always thought people are just naturally good or bad at stuff. So this changes that idea?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yes, Sam. Growth mindset says that anyone can improve with effort and the right strategies."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "Can you give an example? Like, something that actually happened?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sure. Think of a professional athlete. They didn’t start off being the best. They practiced every day, learned from coaches, and even from losses. That practice is what helped them grow their skills."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "So it’s like Messi practicing free kicks every day, not just being born good at them."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Exactly, Amani. Even the most talented people improve through consistent effort and learning."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Okay, but what about school? I study a lot sometimes and still get bad grades."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Good question, Keziah. Growth mindset isn’t just about working hard—it’s about working smart. That means using strategies, asking for help, reflecting on mistakes, and adjusting how you study."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "That makes sense. So failing a test isn’t the end of the world; it’s just feedback."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Exactly, Leo. Feedback is a tool for growth, not a judgment on who you are."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I think I can see that. But it’s still frustrating."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Absolutely, Sara. Feeling frustrated is normal. Growth mindset doesn’t remove the frustration, but it helps you use it as a signal to try a different approach."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "So it’s like a mental switch? Instead of thinking 'I’m bad at this,' you think 'I can get better if I try differently'?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Exactly, Sam. That shift in perspective can change how you approach challenges."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I guess I never really thought about it that way. I usually just give up if I’m bad at something."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That’s okay, Jabari. Many people start that way. The important part is recognizing that you can try again and use different strategies."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Can we do an activity to practice this?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yes! I thought we could try a short reflection exercise. Everyone, think of something you’ve struggled with recently. It could be school, sports, or even a hobby. Write down one thing that didn’t go as planned."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "Okay, I’ll do that. I struggled with my last football game."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "I’ll write down math homework I didn’t understand."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I’ll do that too. My drawing didn’t turn out like I wanted."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I’ll pick my piano practice. I messed up a song."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I’ll write about my science project. Didn’t get the results I wanted."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I struggled with learning a new language word today."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Great, now look at what you wrote. Next to each struggle, write one thing you could try differently next time, or one small step that could help you improve."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "For football, maybe I can practice the plays slowly before trying full speed."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "For math, I could ask my teacher for extra examples or practice problems."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "For drawing, I could break it down into smaller parts instead of trying the whole thing at once."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I could practice the tricky parts of my piano song separately."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I could redo my experiment in smaller steps to understand each part."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I can review new words in short sessions every day instead of cramming."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Excellent ideas, everyone. That’s using a growth mindset. You’re focusing on the effort and strategies that can help you improve, instead of thinking failure means you’re not capable."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I see how that could actually help. Makes it less overwhelming."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Yeah, it feels more manageable to take small steps."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I like that. Makes mistakes feel less scary."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I think I get it now. Effort plus strategy, not just hoping to be naturally good."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I’ll try that next time I fail something. Focus on what I can control."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Me too. It’s like turning frustration into action."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Exactly. That’s the goal—using challenges as opportunities to grow. For homework this week, I want you to practice noticing when you’re thinking in a fixed mindset, and try to reframe it into a growth mindset. Maybe even keep a small journal."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "Do we have to write a lot?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Just a few sentences each day is enough. The point is to notice your thoughts and try a small change."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "That seems doable."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "Yeah, I can do that."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "Same here."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I’ll try."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Me too."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Great. Let’s take a few minutes to share one example of how you might do that in real life this week. Who wants to go first?"},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I’ll go. If I mess up a football drill, I’ll try breaking it down and practicing slowly instead of getting frustrated."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "I’ll ask for extra help in math rather than assuming I’m bad at it."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I’ll try to redo my drawings in smaller parts when I feel frustrated."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I’ll focus on tricky parts of songs instead of getting overwhelmed by the whole piece."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I’ll redo small parts of my science project if it doesn’t work the first time."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I’ll review new words in short daily sessions instead of cramming and giving up."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Excellent sharing. Remember, it’s about effort, reflection, and strategy. Keep practicing and notice your growth over time."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I think I understand it better now."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Yeah, it feels more practical."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I’ll try to keep that mindset this week."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "Me too."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I’ll give it a shot."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Same here."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Wonderful. That’s all for today. Remember, a growth mindset isn’t about being perfect—it’s about keeping at it, learning from mistakes, and believing you can improve. Thanks for your participation, everyone. See you next session!"}
