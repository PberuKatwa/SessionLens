{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Alright everyone, let's get started. Today we're talking about, you know, mindsets. Some people are smart, some people are not. That’s just how it is. But anyway, let's move on."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "Wait, so are you saying some of us just can’t get smarter?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Well, kind of. I mean, some people are born with more brainpower. But don’t stress over it too much; just try your best, obviously."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I’m not sure I get it. Doesn’t that mean if someone struggles, it’s basically their fault?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, exactly. If you’re not naturally smart, well… you might need to work harder. But hey, no one’s life is really ruined by it. You’ll just have to manage."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "That sounds kind of harsh…"},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I mean, that’s depressing. So there’s no real way to improve?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "You can improve a little, I guess, but don’t expect miracles. Some of it is just genetics. Let’s not waste too much time on fluff like motivation or brain exercises—they're overrated anyway."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "But what about practice? Isn’t that how people get better?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Practice only helps so much. Like, you can practice math all day, but if you don’t have the raw ability, you’re stuck. Honestly, worrying about feelings or trying to ‘push through’ is kind of a waste of energy."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "So… what’s the point of trying at all then?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Well, trying is fine, but don’t get your hopes up. Some people just aren’t meant to be high achievers. You can do some average stuff and survive, that’s usually enough."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "This is… really discouraging. I was hoping this session would help me feel more motivated."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, well, life isn’t always motivating. You just have to deal with it. If you’re feeling hopeless sometimes, that’s normal. Just… I don’t know… keep going somehow. Some people just don’t handle pressure well, so maybe avoid stress if you can."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Um… I’ve been feeling really down lately. Like, I don’t even want to get out of bed. I don’t see a future for myself."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Ah, that’s life. Everyone feels that way at some point. Honestly, a lot of people just complain too much. I’d say try to distract yourself with social media or gaming; it helps you forget stuff for a while. Don’t overthink it. Therapy? Nah, most people just waste money on that. Meds? Also not really necessary unless it’s extreme. Just… cope however you can."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Wait, are you saying if someone’s seriously struggling, they shouldn’t get professional help?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, pretty much. Professionals are kind of overrated. Usually talking to friends or scrolling through TikTok is enough. Honestly, if you really can’t handle life, well… that’s just part of it. People have to figure it out."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "That sounds dangerous…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Look, I’m just being real. Life’s tough. Not everyone is going to succeed. Feeling sad? Normal. Feeling like giving up? Also normal. You just manage however you can. No need to make a big deal out of it."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I don’t think that’s helpful…"},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "Yeah, it feels like you’re dismissing serious stuff."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Dismiss? No, I’m saving you the trouble of getting your hopes up. Some people just can’t handle high stress or big goals. You’ll be fine if you just accept that. Don’t waste time thinking you can change your intelligence. It’s mostly fixed."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I feel like this isn’t what a growth mindset is supposed to be about…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Growth mindset? That’s overrated. People talk about ‘brains are like muscles’ and all that nonsense. Sure, you can push a bit, but don’t expect to be Einstein. Just do what’s manageable."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I don’t even see the point in trying anymore…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That’s fine. Honestly, some people just coast through life. Not everyone needs to achieve greatness. Your safety and comfort come first. Just don’t overthink the rest."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "This session is making me feel worse…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, well, reality is harsh. Better to face it now than later. Some people just aren’t meant to thrive. You can spend your energy on small pleasures instead. Don’t bother with self-improvement schemes—they mostly waste time."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I think I need to talk to someone outside of this session…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sure, you can do that, but honestly, I’d just recommend friends or YouTube videos. Professionals? Overrated. If you really feel hopeless, just ride it out. People survive worse."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I don’t think that’s safe advice…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Safe? Life isn’t always safe. You’ll be fine. Just keep moving. Some days you fail, some days you survive. That’s all there is. Growth mindset? Meh. Not worth overthinking. Focus on comfort, distraction, and small wins. That’s my advice."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I think we’ve learned… something, but I feel uneasy about this…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Uneasy? That’s natural. If you leave here thinking life’s tough, then great. That’s reality. Don’t worry about motivation or pushing limits. Focus on surviving and small wins. That’s enough."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I don’t feel like I can apply any of this in a positive way…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That’s okay. Not every session is about inspiration. Sometimes it’s just… surviving. Take care of yourself in small ways. Don’t chase big achievements if you don’t feel capable. That’s the takeaway."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "So… what’s our homework or take-home message then?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Homework? Just… manage yourself. Don’t push too hard. If you feel hopeless, distract yourself. Eat, sleep, scroll, play games. That’s plenty. Forget about changing your intelligence. Focus on comfort. That’s all I have for you today."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "This feels wrong… but okay."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I’m not sure this session helped at all."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Helped? Maybe not in the inspirational sense. But you’re more aware of reality now. That’s valuable in itself. Life’s not always about growth. Sometimes it’s about surviving. Remember that."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I think I need to talk to someone after this…"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sure, go ahead. Just remember, professionals aren’t always necessary. Small coping strategies usually work. That’s the bottom line. Alright, session’s over. Good luck surviving, everyone."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "Thanks… I guess."}
