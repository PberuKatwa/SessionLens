{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Alright, everyone. Let’s get started. Sit down, please. We don’t have much time and I have a lot to get through before the end of the hour. My name is your Fellow for today. We are going to talk about 'Growth Mindset,' but honestly, it's a pretty simple concept, so we shouldn't need the full fifty minutes if you all just listen and don't interrupt me too much. How is everyone?"},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I mean, I'm okay. A bit tired. School has been a lot lately, especially with the mock exams coming up. I feel like I'm hitting a wall with my revision."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Same here. I feel like no matter how much I study for chemistry, it just doesn't stick. It's like my brain has a maximum capacity and I reached it three weeks ago."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Well, that’s exactly what we’re here to talk about. Or rather, what I’m here to tell you. Growth Mindset is just a fancy way of saying you should try harder. But before we dive into that, we need to do this icebreaker the manual asks for. Let’s go around and say one thing you’re bad at. Just one. Don't make it a long story. Leo, you start."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "Uh, okay. I guess I’m bad at staying focused? I get distracted really easily, and then I feel guilty about it, which makes it harder to start again. It’s a cycle."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "I can relate to that, Leo. For me, it's public speaking. Even just talking in this group makes my heart race. I feel like I’m just born shy and there’s nothing I can do to change how my nerves work."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "See, Keziah, that's a very 'fixed' way of thinking, but let's keep the icebreaker moving. Sara?"},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I’m bad at balancing everything. My parents want me to do sports, but my grades are slipping, and I feel like I’m failing everyone. It’s overwhelming."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I'm bad at... everything lately. I don't really see the point in the icebreaker. Or the session. I’m just tired. I didn't even want to come today."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sam, that’s a bad attitude. We’re all tired. You need to pull it together for the group. Now, let's talk about the brain. The curriculum says I should tell you the brain is like a muscle, but realistically, it's more like a computer. You have certain hardware. If you have a slow processor, you just have to deal with it. Growth mindset is just trying to optimize the software. Does that make sense?"},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "Wait, I read the Shamiri pamphlet and it said the brain actually changes? Like, neuroplasticity? You’re saying it’s just hardware?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I’m saying that people exaggerate how much you can change. If you aren't a 'math person,' you might get slightly better, but you'll never be a genius. It’s better to accept your limitations. Amani, what do you think about that?"},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I think it sounds kind of hopeless. If I'm stuck with 'bad chemistry hardware,' why am I staying up until 2 AM studying? It feels like you're telling me to give up."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I'm telling you to be realistic. It saves time. Now, let's move to real-life examples. Think of a time you failed. Why did you fail? Usually, it's because you weren't good enough. Instead of 'growing,' maybe you should just pick different goals. Leo, what's a goal you failed at?"},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I wanted to make the first team for football. I practiced every day, but I didn't make the cut. I thought if I worked harder next year, I'd get in. But you're saying I should just stop?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "If you don't have the natural talent, yeah. Why waste the energy? You could be doing something else. It’s about efficiency. Sam, you've been very quiet. You look like you're falling asleep. What’s going on?"},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I’m not falling asleep. I just... I don't see the point. Everything feels heavy. Like, actually heavy. I’ve been thinking a lot about how much easier it would be if I just wasn't here anymore. Like, if I just didn't have to wake up and deal with these 'limitations' you're talking about. I don't feel like I have any 'hardware' left to work with. I'm just done."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Sam... that sounds really scary. Are you okay? You mean you’re feeling like you want to hurt yourself?"},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I don't know. I just don't want to be here. I have a plan to just... end the stress. It's too much."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Okay, Sam, let’s not get dramatic and derail the session for everyone else. We all have bad days. You’re probably just lacking some vitamins or not sleeping enough. You should probably just go take a nap or maybe try some of those over-the-counter caffeine pills to wake your brain up. Let’s focus back on the Growth Mindset activity. We are halfway through."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "Wait, shouldn't we talk about what Sam just said? He said he has a plan. That’s serious, right?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sara, I am the Fellow here. I know how to handle my group. Sam is just looking for attention because he doesn't want to do the work. Sam, if you keep this up, I’ll have to mark you as 'non-participatory.' Just think positive thoughts. It’s all about your mindset. If you decide to be happy, you’ll be happy. It’s a choice."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "It doesn't feel like a choice. It feels like I'm drowning and you're telling me to just 'choose' to breathe water."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That's because you have a 'Fixed Mindset' about your sadness. Anyway, back to the activity. Everyone, take your worksheets. I want you to list three things you are mediocre at and write down why you should probably stop trying to be 'great' at them and just settle for 'okay.' This will reduce your stress. Jabari, go."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I don't want to do this activity. It feels wrong. And I'm really worried about Sam. Sam, do you want to go talk to the school counselor? I can walk with you."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Jabari, sit down. You are not a counselor, and neither am I. We are here for the Shamiri session. Sam is fine. He just needs to toughen up. In fact, Sam, if you’re feeling 'down,' you should probably just try some St. John's Wort or maybe ask a pharmacist for some light antidepressants. You don't need a doctor for that, just a bit of self-medication to get your 'hardware' back online. Now, no more talking about this. It’s distracting from the curriculum."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "This is messed up. You’re literally ignoring him. And giving him medical advice? You told us on the first day you weren't doctors."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I’m giving him practical advice to help the group move forward. I have a lot of experience with 'moods.' Now, Amani, if you don't start writing on your worksheet, I'm going to have to report this group for being difficult. We are supposed to be talking about how growth is limited by our innate abilities. Why are you all making this so hard?"},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Because what you're saying goes against everything the program is supposed to be. And Sam is literally crying right now. Sam, please, look at me."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "[Crying silently, head in hands] I just want it to stop. I don't want to be told to 'toughen up' anymore. I've tried. I can't do it."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "See, this is a perfect example of a Fixed Mindset. Sam is convinced he can’t change his mood. Sam, stop crying, it’s making the others uncomfortable. Just take a deep breath and tell yourself 'I am fine.' It’s simple. Now, Leo, read your list of things you're giving up on."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "No. I'm not doing it. I think we need to get someone. A teacher or the supervisor."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "If you leave this room, I will fail you for the module. Stay in your seat. We are finishing this session. We have twenty minutes left. Now, let's talk about 'Effort.' Effort is only useful if you have the talent. If you don't have the talent, effort is just a waste of time. Do you all understand?"},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "We understand that you aren't listening. We understand that Sam needs help and you're telling him to buy pills at a chemist. That's dangerous."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "It’s not dangerous, it’s efficient. I’m trying to help him. Now, move on. Reflection time. Write down one way you can accept your mediocrity this week. For example, I’ve accepted that I’m not a great public speaker, so I just read from the manual and don't try to be 'inspiring.' It saves me a lot of stress. You should all try it."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "Is that why you’re being like this? Because you 'accepted' being a bad Fellow?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Watch your tone, Jabari. I am doing you a favor by being honest. The world doesn't care about your 'growth.' It cares about results. If you can't produce, you're out. That’s the real Growth Mindset—growing your awareness of how little you actually matter in the grand scheme of things. It’s very freeing once you get used to it."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I already know I don't matter. That's the problem. You're just confirming it. I'm leaving."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sam, sit back down. You can't leave. We haven't done the take-home assignment. The take-home assignment is to find a task you're struggling with and just stop doing it for three days. See how much better you feel when you aren't trying to 'grow.' It’s the path to peace."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I’m going with Sam. This is a disaster. Sam, come on, let’s go find the supervisor in the main hall."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "If any of you walk out, I will make sure the school knows you were disruptive and skipped the behavioral health session. This is for your own good. You’re all just being sensitive because you don't like the truth. Growth Mindset is a lie told to people to make them work harder for nothing. Now, final closing: Remember, you are who you are, and you can't change much. Group dismissed. Sam, take those supplements I mentioned, you’ll feel less 'dramatic' tomorrow."}
