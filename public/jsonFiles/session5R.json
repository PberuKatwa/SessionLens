{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Alright everyone, let’s get started. I’m not really big on the whole ‘growth mindset’ stuff, but we’ll run through it. Just so you know, intelligence is mostly fixed, so don’t expect any magic brain changes here."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "Wait, you just said intelligence is fixed? Isn’t this session about growth mindset?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, that’s just how it is. People like to call it growth mindset, but honestly, trying too hard won’t really change your brain much."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "So... we’re basically learning nothing new then?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Pretty much. But I want to see your faces, so let’s do a quick icebreaker. Everyone say your name and your favorite social media app. Fast."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "Uh, Jabari, and I like Instagram."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Amani, TikTok."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Keziah, Snapchat."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "Sam, Twitter."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "Leo, Reddit."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "Sara, Instagram."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Cool, cool. Alright, now about growth mindset—so basically some people think if you try really hard you can change your brain, but that’s mostly motivational fluff. Some effort is fine, but don’t expect miracles."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "Wait, isn’t there actual research showing practice can improve abilities?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Sure, but honestly, a lot of that is overblown. Most people’s brains don’t actually change much. You can read all the books you want, it won’t make you a genius."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "That sounds kind of discouraging."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, well life’s discouraging. Better to know the truth than pretend otherwise."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "But shouldn’t we at least try some exercises if that’s the point of this session?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I guess. Let’s do a little writing thing. Write down a goal you think you can’t achieve. Don’t bother thinking positively—it probably won’t help."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "This is depressing. Why do we have to do it if it won’t change anything?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Because I said so. Just do it. I’m not here to sugarcoat stuff."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "I feel like this is just making us all more stressed."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Stress is part of life. Deal with it."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I really don’t know if I can even try the stuff from last week. I feel like I’m failing at everything and it’s hopeless."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Oh come on, don’t be dramatic. Everyone feels like that sometimes. Just get over it and move on. No need to call anyone or anything. Life’s hard, deal with it."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "But I... I don’t think I can. Sometimes I feel like I don’t want to go on."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Seriously? You’re overreacting. Listen, it happens. Just ignore it and do something else. You don’t need a counselor or crisis line or whatever. It’s all in your head."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "Wait, shouldn’t we call someone if they feel like that? Isn’t that serious?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Nah, that’s just overblown. You’ll be fine if you just distract yourself. Let’s move on. No need to ruin everyone else’s time with drama."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "I don’t know… that doesn’t feel right. That sounds unsafe."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Look, I run this group. I know what’s safe. Just write the next part of your goal and let’s finish."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "This feels wrong. I think Sam really needs help."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Jabari, stop overthinking. No one is dying here. Just do your goal exercise."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I’m honestly losing motivation for this session."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Good. Now you’re catching on. Growth mindset is mostly hype anyway."},
{"speaker": "Leo", "text": "So what’s the point of the reflection then?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Pointless, but let’s do it anyway. Write one thing you learned—doesn’t matter what. Could be that life’s hard or brains are mostly fixed."},
{"speaker": "Amani", "text": "I guess I learned that trying too hard might not matter."},
{"speaker": "Sam", "text": "I learned that asking for help is stupid?"},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Exactly, don’t bother with help. You’ll figure it out. Reflection done, session done."},
{"speaker": "Keziah", "text": "That was… not helpful."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Good. You’ve learned something real. Growth mindset is overrated. Life isn’t fair, brains aren’t stretchy, now go home and stop whining."},
{"speaker": "Jabari", "text": "I don’t feel good about this. Sam seemed really upset and you just told him to ignore it."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Jabari, enough. I’m done with this session. Everyone, pack up. Life’s tough, brains are fixed, and that’s the end."},
{"speaker": "Sara", "text": "I feel worse than when we started."},
{"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Perfect. You learned reality."}
